22114335,For more efficient and readable queries it can be worth making `active_until` a `NOT NULL` field and using a distant future date. If Rails and the Pg gem support infinite dates use `+infinity` as the date; otherwise use the biggest date Rail and the Pg gem do support. This only makes sense if a fairly large proportion of your records have a non-null `active_until` field; if only a smaller fraction have `active_until` set you can use `null` for the unset ones and create a partial index on `(active_until) WHERE (active_until IS NOT NULL)`,2013-03-24 05:35:27.846999 UTC,15594907,398670,,0

Reply to everyone:

Thanks for your help. I have used a combination of things:

a). I only accept the data sent as $_POST
b). I send all $.post through a single .php file, which then ""includes"" the variable. eg: $.post(""poster.php"",{ajax_file: ajax_file})
c). I obfuscate the ""ajax_file"", and I don't include the full path either. So there is no way to know the entire path to the ajax file unless they are good at guessing.
d). All direct ajax files exit();, if not loaded from poster.php (simple var exists test) - even if they get to the file directly, it won't work.",2010-03-21 10:41:20.947000 UTC,2486327,298339,,0

Readiness probes are only used at startup to make sure the pod is ready before sending traffic. Once a pod is ready the readiness probe is no longer checked and future checks use livenessProbe. PreStop lets you reuse generic containers and do custom actions per pod instead of building a specialized container per application/pod to handle clean shutdowns.,2016-11-16 16:57:28.137000 UTC,40625106,1596392,,0

Sorry, i was away from this conversation
so couldn't reply on time
& Regarding dependency injection, i'm saying that. 

If i add jquery before angular & then while building code, Grunt's wiredep task automatically changes order of jquery (first angular and then jquery). 

If i comment that wiredep task of grunt, then while building code it doesn't changes the order (takes same as i placed in index.html file).

Means, wiredp task is automatically changes order of jquery & angular js..

What can be reason here?

I already pointed out that Haswell has higher latency CMOV and complex-LEA than Bulldozer, so yes, in this purely CPU-bound specific loop, Bulldozer runs it significantly faster than Haswell, enough to overcome a 1.4:1 clock-speed difference (modulo measurement error with power-saving).  The Haswell is generally faster on average, but that doesn't mean it's faster at everything.  (BTW, Broadwell and Skylake would run this about 20% faster per clock than Haswell, since they handle CMOV as 1uop with 1c latency.)",2016-11-02 04:59:01.660000 UTC,40356449,224132,,0

Re `bind`: In ES5, true JavaScript functions have a `[bind](http://es5.github.com/#x15.3.4.5)` property which refers to a function that accepts the object to use as `this` (and optional other arguments) and returns a function that, when called, will call the original function with `this` as the object you gave. So `f = foo.bind(o);` creates a function and assigns it to the `f` variable which, when called, will call `foo` with `this` set to `o`.

66380736,@user5367782  sorry I thought I had read 3 choices but the idea is to split up your package based on what task/data flow you would run per user choice and have X number of packages instead of one package then when the user makes their choice in your GUI you would execute a particular package not having to pass a parameter rather than executing an all inclusive package and passing a parameter. Two main benefits 1) SSIS part will be designed without relying on user input 2) the logic of what task to execute will be fully contained within your external program instead of split between both,2016-09-16 13:54:20.217000 UTC,39506911,5510627,,0

One of the reasons to stick to matrices is that operations on matrices in R are much faster than on data.frames.  If your non-numeric data represents IDs of some sort then they probably identify separate series anyways.  In that case, the `split=` arg in `read.zoo` handles that.

The default field separator for AWK is already space and tab, there's usually no need to set it to space. AWK can do `grep`-`grep`'s job. There's no need for the semicolon where you have it in the AWK. It's a good idea to develop the habit of always quoting your variables when they're expanded (move the quotes to the outside of your filename for example).
